# Competition - Inception-v3 vs. ResNet50
This is the repository associated with the first project of the Deep Learning course taught at the University of Groningen.

The aim of the project is to compare the two Artificial Neural Networks Architectures `Inception-v3` and `ResNet-50`, available as Transfer Learning models, with each other in various conditions.

The folder `Models` contains the implementations used for conducting this research. For ResNet, all settings tested can be found in a respective file, while there is only one file showing one example setting for the tested Inception model. 


The research has been conducted using Python3 and TensorFlow 2.1.0.
